# Contributing to ada-bot

Hi! Thank you for your interest, let's make this thing useful! :tada:

Since I don't actually know how to sensibly lay out a Golang project, here are some steps which I think should be followed till I/We figure it out:

  * Clone the code first from THIS repository with (assuming your have set $GOPATH already):  
     `go get github.com/adayoung/ada-bot`
  * Fork the repository with the shiny Fork button at the top right
  * Change the origin fetch/push URL to point to YOUR repository:  
     `cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/adayoung/ada-bot`  
     `git remote set-url origin https://github.com/<YOUR GITHUB USERNAME>/ada-bot.git`
  * Make your changes, commit, and push!
  * Create a pull request and we'll merge it together!
  * Oh, that's all there is to it really. Suggestions welcome!
